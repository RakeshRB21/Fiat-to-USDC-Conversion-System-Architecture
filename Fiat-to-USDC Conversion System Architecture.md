---

# **Fiat-to-USDC Conversion System Architecture**

---

## **1. Introduction**

The fiat-to-USDC conversion system is designed to securely and seamlessly convert fiat currency (like USD) into USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. Dollar. This architecture is focused on accuracy, security, and regulatory compliance to ensure that each transaction is processed reliably, with built-in error handling and reconciliation procedures.

---

## **2. Objective**

The system is built to:
- **Reliably Distribute USDC**: Ensure USDC is accurately transferred to users’ wallets upon receiving fiat deposits.
- **Ensure Accurate Reconciliation**: Track and match each fiat deposit with its corresponding USDC transfer to prevent discrepancies.
- **Gracefully Handle Errors**: Manage issues such as transaction delays, failed transfers, and discrepancies through robust error-handling mechanisms.
- **Meet Regulatory Compliance**: Follow KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) standards to meet regulatory requirements.

---

## **3. Key Terms**

- **Fiat Currency**: Government-issued money like USD, EUR, or INR, deposited by users to convert into USDC.
- **USD Coin (USDC)**: A stablecoin pegged 1:1 with the U.S. Dollar, providing a stable value for digital transactions.
- **Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Wallet**: A wallet requiring multiple authorizations for high-value transactions, adding security to the system.
- **Reconciliation**: The process of verifying that each fiat deposit matches a corresponding USDC distribution, ensuring accuracy.
- **Liquidity Pool**: A reserve of USDC, providing funds to meet user requests and drawing from external sources if needed.

## **4. System Components and Architecture**

### **4.1 Overview of System Architecture**

![overall_arch](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk4IHjyzye.png)


This section provides a high-level explanation of the system’s primary components and their functions:

- **User Interface (UI)**: The starting point where users initiate fiat deposits, view balances, and manage accounts.
- **API Gateway**: Directs user requests to backend services, managing load and enforcing security measures.
- **Authentication and Authorization Service**: Verifies user identity and enforces access control, using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- **Fiat Processing Module**: Monitors the platform’s bank account for fiat deposits, verifies each deposit, and matches it to the corresponding user.
- **Treasury Management System**: Holds the main reserve of USDC and oversees the distribution of funds to user wallets.
- **Liquidity Pool Manager**: Sources additional USDC from internal or external reserves when the treasury balance is low, ensuring continuous availability.
- **User Wallet Service**: Manages user-specific wallets where USDC is stored after successful conversion, supporting both custodial and non-custodial options.
- **Transaction Monitoring System**: Observes blockchain transactions to confirm successful USDC transfers to user wallets.
- **Reconciliation Engine**: Matches each fiat deposit to its corresponding USDC transfer, recording and resolving any discrepancies.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Failed Authentication**: If multiple login attempts fail, users are locked out and an alert is triggered for security review.
- **Insufficient Liquidity in Treasury**: The system automatically pulls from the Liquidity Pool Manager. If insufficient funds persist, the treasury team is notified for manual intervention.
- **Transfer Error in User Wallet Service**: Retry attempts are made to resolve transfer issues before alerting the admin team for review.

Each component plays a specific role, with decision points and error handling measures incorporated for a streamlined transaction process.

- **User Interface (UI)**: Provides an interface for users to initiate deposits, view balances, and manage their wallets.
- **API Gateway**: Manages requests from the UI, routing them to appropriate backend services, ensuring load balancing and security.
- **Authentication and Authorization Service**: Uses MFA to ensure secure access to the platform.
- **Fiat Processing Module**: Detects deposits through bank integration, verifies amounts, and associates deposits with user accounts.
- **Treasury Management System**: Manages USDC reserves, alerts the system to low reserves, and handles transfer errors if they arise.
- **Liquidity Pool Manager**: Monitors the reserve and sources USDC from internal or external sources, managing rate checks and potential delays.
- **User Wallet Service**: Facilitates USDC deposits to user wallets, allowing users to manage funds with both custodial and non-custodial options.
- **Transaction Monitoring System**: Confirms blockchain transfers, tracking delays or discrepancies.
- **Reconciliation Engine**: Detects and corrects errors by reconciling fiat deposits with USDC transfers, generating reports for accuracy.


**Edge Cases**:
- **Bank API Downtime**: If the bank’s API goes down, the system switches to batch reconciliation mode to detect deposits until real-time access is restored.
- **Mismatched User IDs in Fiat Processing**: If a deposit reference doesn’t match any user, the transaction is flagged as pending and the reconciliation team is notified.
- **Insufficient Liquidity Pool Funds**: If external liquidity cannot meet demand, rate adjustments or manual interventions are triggered.

## **5. Transaction Flow**

A typical transaction flows through the system as follows:

1. **User Initiates Fiat Deposit**: The process begins when a user transfers fiat to the platform’s bank account with a unique reference ID.
2. **API Gateway**: Routes the deposit request to the Authentication and Authorization Service for secure processing.
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Validates the user’s credentials before allowing transaction processing.
4. **Fiat Processing Module**: Detects the deposit, verifies the amount, and links the deposit to the user account.
5. **Treasury Management System**: Checks if there’s sufficient USDC in reserve. If reserves are low, the Liquidity Pool Manager sources additional USDC.
6. **Liquidity Pool Manager**: Provides extra USDC if needed, pulling from external sources.
7. **User Wallet Service**: Transfers the verified USDC amount into the user’s wallet.
8. **Transaction Monitoring System**: Observes the blockchain transfer, confirming the success of the transaction.
9. **Reconciliation Engine**: Matches the fiat deposit with the USDC transfer, updating records and flagging any discrepancies.

**Edge Cases**:
- **No Deposit Confirmation**: If the bank doesn’t confirm the deposit within a set period, the system retries the confirmation process. If retries are exhausted, an admin alert is triggered.
- **Insufficient Treasury Funds**: If the Treasury Management System can’t pull enough USDC, the Liquidity Pool Manager attempts rebalancing. If it still fails, the treasury team is alerted.
- **Transfer Failure in User Wallet Service**: If the transfer fails, the system retries. After several failed attempts, the admin team is notified for manual intervention.

The Reconciliation Engine ensures each fiat deposit aligns with a corresponding USDC transfer, maintaining system integrity.

- **Reconciliation Engine**: Receives and cross-checks data from fiat bank records, the treasury balance, and user wallet balances.
- **Discrepancy Detection**: Compares each fiat deposit with the equivalent USDC transfer, flagging mismatches.
- **Error Correction**: Automatically corrects minor discrepancies, while major issues trigger a manual review.
- **Report Generation**: Documents the reconciliation status and logs any flagged transactions for future reference.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Bank Records Missing**: If the bank’s API fails, reconciliation is temporarily deferred until records are available.
- **Inconsistent Wallet Balances**: If user wallet balances don’t match expected values, an alert is sent to the reconciliation team for further investigation.

## **7. Error Handling and Recovery Pathways**

The system includes structured error-handling pathways for issues like failed deposits, retries, and discrepancies.

![Error Analysis](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJaMisJzkx.png)


1. **Transaction Begins**: The process starts when a user initiates a transaction.
2. **Fiat Deposit Confirmed?**: If confirmation fails, the system retries up to three times before escalating.
3. **Transfer to User Wallet**: After successful confirmation, the USDC is transferred to the user’s wallet.
4. **USDC Transfer Successful?**: If the transfer fails, it’s retried several times before the admin is notified.
5. **Reconciliation**: The Reconciliation Engine matches each transaction, checking for discrepancies.
6. **Discrepancy Detected?**: If discrepancies arise, they’re flagged for manual review.

**Edge Cases**:
- **Max Retries for Deposit Confirmation**: If deposit confirmation retries exceed the set limit, an admin alert is triggered.
- **Discrepancy Detection at Reconciliation**: If discrepancies exceed a threshold, the system triggers an alert for the compliance team to review.
