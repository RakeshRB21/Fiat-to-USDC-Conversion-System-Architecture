# **Fiat-to-USDC Conversion System**

[**Project Documentation on HackMD**](https://hackmd.io/@dNh9hWn3Qiay096pcQATQg/Rakesh-21BAI1031)

## **Overview**

The Fiat-to-USDC Conversion System is designed to securely and efficiently convert fiat currency (e.g., USD) into USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. Dollar. This system ensures that transactions are processed accurately, reconciled efficiently, and comply with regulatory standards, making it a robust solution for fintech applications requiring secure currency conversions.

---

## **Features**

- **Reliable USDC Distribution**: Transfers USDC to user wallets immediately upon fiat deposit confirmation.
- **Accurate Reconciliation**: Ensures that each fiat deposit matches a corresponding USDC issuance, preventing discrepancies.
- **Error Handling**: Manages issues like transaction delays, failed transfers, and discrepancies with retry mechanisms and alerts.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) standards, ensuring secure and compliant transactions.
- **Modular Design**: Divides processes into key components for easy maintenance and scalability.

## **Architecture**

The system architecture includes the following main components:

1. **User Interface (UI)**: The starting point where users initiate fiat deposits, view balances, and manage accounts.
2. **API Gateway**: Routes user requests to backend services, ensuring load balancing and security.
3. **Authentication and Authorization Service**: Verifies user identity and manages access control with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
4. **Fiat Processing Module**: Detects fiat deposits, verifies amounts, and associates deposits with user accounts.
5. **Treasury Management System**: Holds USDC reserves and initiates transfers to user wallets.
6. **Liquidity Pool Manager**: Sources additional USDC from internal or external reserves to maintain liquidity.
7. **User Wallet Service**: Manages user-specific wallets, supporting both custodial and non-custodial options.
8. **Transaction Monitoring System**: Tracks and confirms blockchain transactions.
9. **Reconciliation Engine**: Matches each fiat deposit to a USDC issuance, logging and resolving discrepancies.

## **Edge Case Scenarios**

The system handles multiple edge cases, such as:
- **Failed Authentication**: Limits login attempts and notifies the security team after multiple failures.
- **Insufficient Liquidity in Treasury**: Triggers the Liquidity Pool Manager to source additional funds and, if needed, alerts the treasury team.
- **Transfer Errors in User Wallet Service**: Initiates retries for failed transfers, alerting the admin team if retries are exhausted.
- **Bank API Downtime**: Switches to batch reconciliation mode if the bank’s real-time API is unavailable.
- **Discrepancies in Reconciliation**: Flags mismatched records for review, ensuring transparency and accuracy.

---

## **System Requirements**

- **Programming Language**: Python, Node.js, or any server-side language for backend development.
- **Database**: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for transaction records and reconciliation data.
- **Blockchain Support**: Ethereum or compatible blockchain network for USDC transactions.
- **External Integrations**:
  - **Bank API**: For real-time fiat deposit detection and reconciliation.
  - **KYC/AML Provider**: For regulatory compliance checks.
  - **Liquidity Source**: External liquidity pool or exchange (e.g., Aave, Compound) for additional USDC.

## **Usage**

1. **Initiate a Fiat Deposit**:
   Users can log in to the UI, initiate a fiat deposit, and receive a unique reference number for tracking.

2. **Conversion Process**:
   - Once the fiat deposit is detected, the Fiat Processing Module verifies it.
   - The Treasury Management System then allocates the equivalent USDC, transferring it to the user’s wallet.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - In case of failed transfers, the system retries the transaction.
   - For discrepancies or system alerts, the admin team is notified for intervention.

4. **Reconciliation and Monitoring**:
   - The Reconciliation Engine matches fiat deposits with USDC distributions.
   - The Transaction Monitoring System verifies successful blockchain transactions, providing a real-time dashboard for tracking.

## **Error Handling and Edge Cases**

This system handles various edge cases with robust error handling, including:
- **Authentication Failures**: Multiple failed login attempts lock out users and notify the security team.
- **Insufficient Liquidity**: If the treasury lacks sufficient USDC, the system pulls from the Liquidity Pool Manager, triggering manual alerts if liquidity is still insufficient.
- **Transaction Delays**: The system retries delayed or failed transfers and escalates unresolved issues to the admin team.
- **Reconciliation Discrepancies**: All discrepancies are logged, and unresolved mismatches are flagged for manual review.
